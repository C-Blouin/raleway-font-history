        <h2><em>Raleway</em> \ <strong>History</strong></h2>
        <div>
          <p>
            The <strong>Raleway</strong> typeface was created by
            <a
              href="https://matt.cc/"
              target="_blank"
              title="Matt's Personal Website"
              >Matt Mclnerney</a
            >
            in 2010 with a single font weight in mind, through its popularity,
            the font has seen additions including weight and style variations,
            an example being bold or italics. <strong>Raleway</strong> was
            designed specifically for web usage in mind and is widely utilized
            throughout the web development environment across various design
            projects. <strong>Raleway</strong> is a modern font that holds a
            unique elegance of design when considering the view of the web
            today.
          </p>
          <p>
            Matt’s inspiration for the font occurred during a trip to Paris,
            where a font he liked appeared on a sign, and a photo was taken to
            inspire the <strong>Raleway</strong> font.
            <strong>Raleway</strong> is amongst the first fonts Matt McInerney
            developed within his own type design business and his first font
            that became available for commercial use. One of the interesting
            aspects of <strong>Raleway's</strong> history is that it was one of
            the first fonts that Matt McInerney created when he started his own
            design business. <strong>Raleway</strong> was his first font that
            was available for commercial use.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          Though the <strong>Raleway</strong> font has not been around for
          various decades, it has developed rapidly in becoming a popular choice
          when working with web projects that need a professional, modern
          approach.

        <h2><em>Raleway</em> \ <strong>Design</strong></h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Raleway</strong> is a modern sans-serif font that is widely
          utilized in headlines and titles primarily as a display text, the
          clean appearance allows legible body text.
          <strong>Raleway</strong> consists of a sharp, professional feel that
          compliments modern design very well. Due to its pronounced ligatures
          and legible appearance, it allows users to feel drawn in by the
          content while creating consistent contrast with many elements in a web
          page’s design. <strong>Raleway</strong> consistently showcases
          elegance through specific glyphs to grab the attention of the human
          eye, maintaining flow throughout text.
        </p>
        <h3><em>Key Takeaways </em> \</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The font contains very straight lines which provide a modern touch.
          </li>
          <li>Sharp edges showcase a sleek professional feel.</li>
          <li>
            Line contrast provides the type with a sense of thick and thin flow
            through each letter.
